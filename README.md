Modern React with Redux - Course Update!

116,778 people have taken my course Modern React with Redux.  I think it might be one of the most popular courses online for React!

But...As good as the course is, it could be better.  To improve the course and make it the best, most up-to-date, and complete resource on React, I am completely recreating it!  This will be a completely free update.  If you already own the course you will get this update automatically.

The revised version of this course will include all the same topics currently covered, but also include many advanced topics as well.  That's where I need your help. Are there any topics in the React and Redux world that you want to learn about? If so, let me know using this form: https://goo.gl/forms/LNGL1NtSrYzYanjH2

Here's a partial list of some of the advanced topics that will be covered in the course:

    Portals

    Hooks

    Deployment

    List Virtualization

    Basic Typescript integration

    Redux Saga

Here's a question I'm sure you have: If you're taking the course right now, should you stop and wait for the update?

No, don't stop!  Keep going through the course as it stands right now.  All the fundamental topics, such as React components, state, forms, Redux, React Router, will be more or less the same in the updated version of the course.
